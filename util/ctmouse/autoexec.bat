REM CuteMouse is a DOS based, open source mouse driver, which supports many
REM protocols of serial and PS/2 mice. It can search for a serial mouse at
REM all COM ports or only at a specified port. An important CuteMouse feature
REM is its small memory footprint: the resident part (TSR) occupies less than
REM 3.5K. CuteMouse can also install itself in upper memory, when available,
REM without requiring external utilities such as the LH (LoadHigh) command.
REM Modern BIOSes often make USB mice visible through the PS/2 interface if you
REM enable "legacy" support in BIOS setup.
REM
REM CuteMouse has three branches now. V1.9 branch uses BIOS to handle PS/2 mice
REM V2.0 branch uses direct hardware access for PS/2 mice, and supports the
REM wheel. V2.1 branch uses BIOS to handle PS/2 mice but also supports the wheel
REM , combining the best of V1.9 and V2.0. Wheel programming info is included in
REM the v2.x packages. RAR and ZIP commands
