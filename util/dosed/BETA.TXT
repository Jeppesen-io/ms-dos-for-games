       This is a beta-version of the program. It might contain several
       bugs. If this makes you feel uncomfortable, don't use the program,
       but wait until the `real' version is available.


       If you do not accept the following, please do not use the program:

           * The program should not be used longer than three months after
             the release date. At that time a new version should be
             available at the same location you got this one.

           * Any bugs (minor or major) must be reported to the author.
             See the .DOC-file for my full address. I'm also happy to
             know of any spelling or grammatical errors in the text-files.

           * If you give this program to others, you must let them know
             that this is a beta-version, and tell them to read this file.
             When a new version is available, you are responsible for
             giving it to those you gave the beta-version. That way all
             beta-versions will disappear. If you don't want this
             responsibility, don't make the program available to others.

       If all this demanding talk didn't frighten you away, start enjoying
       the program now. I hate saying all this, but I want as few as
       possible of _my_ bugs beeing spread around the world! :-)


                                                      Sverre.
